        "description":"Students are dropped from a low altitude with the static line attached to their parachute. As they fall away from the plane, their parachute is automatically deployed. After learning to exit stable, students begin pulling their own parachutes, and are gradually dropped from higher altitudes to give them longer increments of freefall time.",

        "description":"Students are dropped from full altitude right away with 2 instructors holding on to each side of them. After a few jumps the instructors begin releasing the student and giving them more freedom to practice freefall skills.",
